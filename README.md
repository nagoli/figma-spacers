# «Spacers» plugin for Figma


## About the plugin 
Autolayout are great but the constant space between components is sometimes an issue.
This Figma plugin allows to easily insert spacers in Figma autolayout.
**In this first version only base-8 vertical spacers are available.**
Spacers infos can be shown or hidden as you do in a word processor with the pilcrow (¶).


## About using spacers 
Spacers are [not a correct practice in HTML](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/C18.html) since the presentation concerns must be defined in CSS.  
But Figma is a design tool – Should the HTML-CSS specialization be a concern in Figma?

In practice, spacers in autolayout speed up the design. 
Set vertical autolayout to your main frame and just add components inside. 
Add spacers to easily adjust the distance between components and keep the magic of autolayout.
