> Add custom spaces between component

Select the component where to add a spacer.
Choose your direction 
Choose your spacer size
And the spacer is added to your design 

> Hide and show spacers in one clic

Just switch to see spacers or not 
The state is saved in the document so you can share it clean. Anyone with the plugin can show them back. 

> Create new autolayouts in seconds 

If you add a spacer in a direction that does not fit with the parent autolayout, Spacers plugin smartly adds you a new autolayout. 

It also works with multi selection in a same frame : select at least the first and last element you need to move with a spacer and a inner autolayout will be created.
