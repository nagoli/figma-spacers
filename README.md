# «Spacers» plugin for Figma

## About the plugin 
Figma Autolayout are so great. But the uniformity of spaces between components may be boring :-( .

This Figma plugin enables heteregeneous spaces in autolayout.

Spacer infos can be shown or hidden just as the pilcrow button (¶) of a word processor.

**In this first version only base-8 vertical spacers are available.**


## About using spacers 
Spacers are [not a correct practice in HTML](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/C18.html) since the presentation concerns must be managed in CSS.  
But Figma is a design tool …

In practice, spacers in autolayout speed up the design. They allow you to put almost everything in autolayout, but limiting the number of stacking frames.   

Set vertical autolayout to your main frames, just add components inside and spacers between them – just simple.
